Project Report: Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

Tasks:

1. Data Preprocessing:

1.1 Importing the Dataset:
The initial phase involved importing the eCommerce dataset, which was retrieved from the provided Kaggle link. The dataset was loaded into a panda DataFrame, allowing for efficient exploration and manipulation of the data.

1.2 Handling Missing Values:

1.2.1 Description Column (1454 missing values):
The 'Description' column had 1454 missing values. After careful consideration, it was decided to retain these missing values in the dataset. Since our focus is on RFM analysis for customer segmentation, the absence of a product description for certain entries is not deemed critical.

1.2.2 CustomerID Column (135,080 missing values):
The 'CustomerID' column, crucial for customer identification in RFM analysis, had 135,080 missing values. To ensure the integrity of customer-centric analysis, rows with missing 'CustomerID' entries were removed from the dataset. This approach allows us to concentrate on customers with identifiable information.

1.3 Converting Data Types:

1.3.1 InvoiceDate Column:
The 'InvoiceDate' column, originally in object format, was converted to the datetime64[ns] data type. This conversion facilitates seamless handling of date-related calculations, ensuring accurate recency calculations for RFM analysis.

1.3.2 CustomerID Column:
The 'CustomerID' column, initially represented as floating-point numbers, was converted to the int64 data type. This conversion aligns with standard practices for customer identification and supports compatibility with subsequent calculations.


2. RFM Calculation:
In this section, we further refined the RFM metrics by incorporating the most recent purchase date and additional transaction-related metrics.

2.1 Recent Purchase Date (Recency - R):
To calculate the recency (R) of each customer, we first converted the 'InvoiceDate' to the 'InvoiceDay' column, representing the date of each transaction. The maximum 'InvoiceDay' was then identified as the most recent purchase date across all customers. The 'Days_Since_Last_Purchase' metric was computed by subtracting the most recent date from each customer's last purchase date.

2.2 Total Transactions (Frequency - F):
To gauge the frequency (F) of customer transactions, we determined the total number of unique invoices ('Total_Transactions') for each customer. This metric quantifies how often a customer engages in transactions with the business.

2.3 Total Products Purchased:
To enrich our understanding of customer behavior, we introduced the 'Total_Products_Purchased' metric, representing the total quantity of unique products purchased by each customer. This provides insights into the diversity and breadth of a customer's product preferences.

2.4 Resulting RFM Metrics:
The resulting dataset now includes the following RFM metrics:
* CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
* Days_Since_Last_Purchase: The recency of each customer's last purchase in terms of days.
* Total_Transactions: The total number of unique transactions made by each customer.
* Total_Products_Purchased: The total quantity of unique products purchased by each customer.
These metrics form a more comprehensive view of customer behavior, capturing recency, frequency, and product diversity. The subsequent sections will leverage these refined RFM metrics for customer segmentation, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing and engagement strategies.





3. RFM Segmentation:
In this section, we assigned RFM scores to each customer based on quartiles, enabling the creation of a single RFM score for comprehensive customer segmentation.

3.1 Recency Score (R):
 Methodology:
 The most recent purchase date for each customer was determined, and the 'Days_Since_Last_Purchase' metric was calculated.
 Quartiles were applied to 'Days_Since_Last_Purchase' to create Recency Scores, with lower scores indicating more recent purchases.

3.2 Frequency Score (F):
 Methodology:
 Total transactions ('Total_Transactions') for each customer were calculated, and frequency ranks were assigned based on transaction counts.
 Quartiles were applied to the frequency ranks to create Frequency Scores, with higher scores indicating more frequent transactions.

3.3 Monetary Score (M):
Methodology:
Totals spend ('Total_Spend') for each customer was calculated, and quartiles were applied to create Monetary Scores, with higher scores indicating higher monetary contributions.

3.4 Creating RFM Score:
Methodology:
The Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Scores were combined to create a single RFM score for each customer, providing a holistic view of their engagement and contribution to the business.

3.5 Resulting RFM Segmentation:
The resulting dataset now includes the following RFM metrics and segmentation:
¥ CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
¥ Recency_Score: Recency score based on quartiles.
¥ Frequency_Score: Frequency score based on quartiles.
¥ Monetary_Score: Monetary score based on quartiles.
¥ RFM_Score: Combined RFM score, indicating the overall engagement and value contribution of each customer.


4. Customer Segmentation:
In this section, we utilized clustering techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, to segment customers based on their RFM scores. The objective was to uncover meaningful groups that share similar characteristics, aiding in targeted marketing and engagement strategies.

4.1 Data Scaling:
Prior to clustering, the RFM scores (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) were standardized using the StandardScaler. Standardization ensures that all features contribute equally to the clustering process, preventing any metric from dominating the results due to differences in scale.

4.2 Identifying Optimal Number of Clusters:
To determine the optimal number of clusters, the Elbow Method was employed. The Elbow Method involves fitting the K-Means algorithm with a range of cluster numbers and plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The "elbow" in the plot signifies the optimal number of clusters, where further partitioning offers diminishing returns.

4.3 K-Means Clustering:
Based on the Elbow Method, a specific number of clusters (k) was selected. In this case, k = 4 was deemed appropriate for segmenting the customers.
The K-Means algorithm was then applied to the standardized RFM scores, resulting in the assignment of each customer to a specific cluster. The 'Cluster' column in the dataset indicates the segment to which each customer belongs.

4.4 Resulting Customer Segmentation:
The resulting dataset now includes the 'Cluster' column, providing information about the segment to which each customer belongs. These segments represent groups of customers with similar RFM characteristics.

CustomerID  ...  Cluster
0       12346  ...        2
1       12347  ...        3
2       12348  ...        0
3       12349  ...        1
4       12350  ...        2
...         ...  ...      ...
4367    18280  ...        2
4368    18281  ...        2
4369    18282  ...        3
4370    18283  ...        3
4371    18287  ...        1

4.5 Visualizing the Clusters:
The Elbow Method plot was instrumental in determining the optimal number of clusters. By selecting an appropriate number of clusters, we ensure that each segment is distinct and meaningful, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies.
